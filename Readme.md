# Regression Project

The aim of this project is to predict a continous target variable using multiple Machine Learning algorithms (Random Forest, Linear regression) and deep learning networks.

We will predict the critical temperature of a superconductor using 81 independent variables. We will also apply and compare different methods to reduce the size of the manipulated data( Features selection, Principal component analysis...)
